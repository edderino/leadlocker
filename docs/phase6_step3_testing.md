2. Access client dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/client/demo-org`

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools Console (`F12`)
2. Navigate to client dashboard
3. Look for AI Suggestions section above Analytics Overview
4. Check console logs for: `[AISuggestions] Loaded X suggestions for org: demo-org`

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… AI Suggestions section visible
- âœ… Console shows successful data analysis
- âœ… Suggestions appear based on actual lead patterns
- âœ… Each suggestion has title, description, action, and priority

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check API directly
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/ai/suggestions?orgId=demo-org" | jq '.suggestions'

# Expected response structure:
{
  "success": true,
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "id": "follow-up-unapproved",
      "title": "Follow Up Required",
      "description": "2 unapproved leads older than 3 days",
      "action": "Review and approve 2 pending leads",
      "priority": "high",
      "icon": "ðŸ“ž"
    }
  ],

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Different organizations get different suggestions
- âœ… No cross-organization data leakage
- âœ… Database queries include `org_id` filter
- âœ… RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check database isolation
SELECT org_id, COUNT(*) as lead_count 
FROM leads 
WHERE org_id IN ('demo-org', 'test-org')
GROUP BY org_id;

-- Check events isolation
SELECT org_id, COUNT(*) as event_count 
FROM events 
WHERE org_id IN ('demo-org', 'test-org')
GROUP BY org_id;
```
